/*
 * OpenDAoC - A branch of the Dawn of Light program
 * 
 * Additions have been made to the original Dawn of Light emulation
 * program to improve overall performance, as well as recreate Dark
 * Age of Camelot v1.65, circa 2003. As such, changes have been made
 * to the overall DOL code base to not only address performance issues,
 * but also to recreate specific behaviors and functionality specific
 * to the Shrouded Isles, pre-ToA (Trials of Atlantis).
 * 
 * Extensive work has been performed since 2021, which makes this
 * project a significant/unique branch from Dawn of Light. Like Dawn
 * of Light, this program is free software and may be distributed openly
 * in the hopes that more DAoC freeshards may come to exist with their
 * own server settings and unique offerings.
 *
 * A special tribute goes out to Clait, Fenyn Ro, Knutters, Flame, 
 * Glimmer, DrMed, Kelteen, and the many other passionate contributors of
 * OpenDAoC, from which the many changes of this program branch came to exist.

/*
 * HavenDAoC - An open source emulation of DAoC v1.65
 * HavenDAoC is a branch of the OpenDAoC program and seeks to recreate
 * the classic Dark Age of Camelot Shrouded Isles, with some quality of life 
 * (QoL) improvements.
 *
 * Changes to the overall classic/SI experience will be kept to a minimum,
 * and any non-classic functionality introduced via DoL or Atlas will be
 * removed or commented out.
 *
 * Additional programs exist, which add to or contribute to this program's
 * accessibility, including a Character Planner (HTML/JS-based), Herald, Wiki,
 * and Launcher app.
